<h1>
  My Cause
  </h1>
<p>
  One cause that drives me in my life is Climate change. 
  Humans are destroying the planet and we have no plan to fix it. 
  The gravity of the situation is not understood by many people or people are denying the facts because it benefits them.
  Many people in power, whether it be in politics or in the 1%, are refusing to acknowledge that have the resources to affect
  serious and needed change. I am trying to spread awareness to the severity of climate by contacting my representatives, educating and 
  updating myself on current statistics, talking to my friends and family, and trying to be more environmentally conscious in my day to 
  day life.
